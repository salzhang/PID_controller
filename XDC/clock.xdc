# Assuming your input clock port is named clk
# Create a clock constraint
create_clock -name clk -period 100 [get_ports {clk}]
#This command creates a clock constraint named "clk" with a period of 100 ns for the input clock port named "clk". 
#This will instruct the synthesis tool to treat the "clk" port as a clock 
#with the specified period during timing analysis and optimization.
