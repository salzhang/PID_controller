# PID_controller
This particular implementation is a high-performance 5-stage pipelined PID controller with a Wishbone B4 slave port which can toggle between 16bit, 32bit and 64bit. The PID controller also uses KSA and Booth Multiplier from my previous designs as you can find them in my previous repo.
